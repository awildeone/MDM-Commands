# MDM Commands and Scripts-
These are the commands that I will regularly build out MDM tenants (Mosyle, JAMF, etc.). It is always evolving with more commands as I create/find ways to impliment things.

## Crashplan Collect Logs

This will copy the Crashplan log folder under /Library/Logs/Crashplan to the desktop and then compress that copied folder. This does not require the user to open the Crashplan desktop app. Sometimes the app does not want to open, so this is a better solution since it does the complicated things for the user. In the future this could just compress the original log folder, but I didn't do it that way (yet) :^)
